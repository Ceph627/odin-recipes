# odin-recipes

The purpose of this repo is to practice all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired so far. In this project, I will be building a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The purpose of this website is not to look pretty but to build my HTML chops. I will be revisiting this in the future to make it look pretty with CSS.
